mysql> show databases;

q2 ).Write an SQL statement to create a simple table countries including columns
country_id,country_name and region_id. After this display the structure of
table as below :

mysql> create table countries(country_id int(10),
    -> country_name varchar(20),
    -> region_id int(10));

job_id, job_title, min_salary, max_salary and check whether the
max_salary amount exceeding the upper limit 25000. Also set job_id as

mysql> CREATE TABLE jobs (
    ->     job_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     job_title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ->     min_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    ->     max_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    ->     CHECK (max_salary <= 25000)
    -> );

q4). Write a SQL statement to create a table named job_histry including columns
employee_id, start_date, end_date, job_id and department_id

mysql> create table job_histry(
    ->  employee_id int,
    ->      start_date date,
    ->      end_date date,
    ->      job_id int,
    ->      department_id int
    ->      );

q5).Write an SQL statement to alter a table named countries to make sure that no
duplicate data against column country_id will be allowed at the time of
insertion.

mysql> ALTER TABLE countries
    -> ADD CONSTRAINT unique_country_id UNIQUE (country_id);
mysql> SHOW INDEX FROM countries WHERE Column_name = 'country_id';

q6).Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns job_id,
job_title, min_salary and max_salary, and make sure that, the default value
for job_title is blank and min_salary is 8000 and max_salary is NULL will be
entered automatically at the time of insertion if no value assigned for the
specified columns.

mysql> create table job(
    -> job_id int not null,
    -> job_title varchar(20) default '',
    -> min_salary int default 8000,
    -> max_salary int default null);

q7)Create a Department table with following structure

CREATE TABLE Department (
    ->     Dept_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,        
    ->     Dept_Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
    ->     Location VARCHAR(100),           
    ->     Manager_ID INT                   
    -> );

salary, commission, manager_id and department_id and make sure that, the
employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of
insertion and the foreign key columns combined by department_id and
manager_id columns contain only those unique combination values, which
combinations are exists in the departments table.

mysql> CREATE TABLE Departments (
    ->     department_id INT,
    ->     manager_id    INT,
    ->     dept_name     VARCHAR(100),
    ->     location      VARCHAR(100),
    ->     CONSTRAINT pk_dept_mgr PRIMARY KEY (department_id, manager_id)
    -> );
